## PROBE-READBACK: Combine probe and config readback into one operation

On connect, two separate `gpscfg.Configure` calls happen in sequence: the initial probe (to detect the receiver and get `ReceiverInfo`) and then the config readback (to get current property values for the Config tab). If the user is already on the Config tab when they reconnect, both could be combined into a single `Configure` call by adding `Get: readProps` to the initial probe target. This would halve the round-trip time for the reconnect case.

Currently the probe is initiated by the Go backend (`packetWorker`) and the readback is initiated by the frontend (`doReadback` via `ReadConfig`). Combining them would require the backend to know whether properties should be read during the probe, or a way to piggyback the readback request onto the probe.
